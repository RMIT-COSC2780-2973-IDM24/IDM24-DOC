## Updates to the spec

- [#64](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15661/discussion/1871078): collects a few clarifications from several posts.
- [#29](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15661/discussion/1850209): reversible assumption on flight links only applies to the particular network in Exercise 1.
- [#28](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15661/discussion/1849446): clarification on pair of cities not as lists; so predicate arity is correct in spec.


## Can I use built-in predicate `P/n`?

This project assignment can be solved neatly using plain basic Prolog built-in predicates. As the Language Restriction section in the specs states you are not to use advanced predicates or libraries. These include all-solution predicates like `findall/3` for example or the constraint libraries: none are needed anyways.

If in doubt always ask in the forum. Some other predicates that you shall not use are:

- `table/1`, `order_by/1`, `sort/2`

Some predicates that you can use as they are still basic are:

- `nth0/3`, `nth1/3`


## How can I compute & carry "so-far" results?

A usual strategy for computing something is to carry intermediate results until the end, and once there, just equate the final result with the result so far.

For example, this is how I can sum a list of numbers:

```prolog
sumar(L, R) :- sumar(L, 0, R).

sumar([], SumSoFar, SumSoFar).
sumar([X|L], SumSoFar, Result) :-
    SumSoFar2 is  SumSoFar + X,
    sumar(L, SumSoFar2, Result).
```

Check a run:

```prolog
?- sumar([1,2,3,4], R).
R = 10.
```

## Can there be decimals in duration and price of flight legs?

No. Duration (in minutes) and price (in $) are always _integers_.

## What does "connected in exactly two flight legs" mean?

It means that you _can_ flight from A to B using two flight legs, regardless whether you can also fly from A to B with just one leg (or with more than two).

## Exercise 3: should the tools also check for proper flight paths?

No.

You can assume that the `Path` given is always a proper legal flight path, that is, it passes/succeeds on `flight_path/1`. ðŸ˜ƒ

This is for all predicates in the exercise, namely, `path_price/2`, `path_duration/2`, `path_airlines/2`, `path_reverse/2`.

If one were to use it somewhere, one would first check that the path is a proper correct flight path, and then use these tools.

## Exercise 6: typo in possible `Criterion`?

As clarified in [#57](https://edstem.org/au/courses/15661/discussion/1866753), the Criterion can be either `duration` or `price`.
